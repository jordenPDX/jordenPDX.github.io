                Hi there! Thanks for checking out my page. Im Jorden, I am currently a senior at Portland State University and in the next few months
                I will graduate with a degree in Computer Science. I'm pretty new to the HTML, CSS, and Java Script scene, but after taking a class on web development;
                I have found it to be very fun and engaging since I can visually see changes I make while I am making them which I think is so cool. I have not yet had
                any experience in industry, but am eager to find an opprotunity to gain industry knowledge and further my CS skills.
            </p>

                    This project is an attempt to make a rudimentary 2D sidescrolling game which its purpose was
                    for our group to gain practice with the Agile/ Scrum development process. So the project was focused on
                    working with other software developers rather than the code itself. <br><br>

                <p>
                    The purpose of this project was to practice with Rust's crate system which is a way for a programmer to
                    seperate parts of a program into simpler containers of code that can also be easily distributed and reused.
                    For this program I made use of the I/O crate that lets the user be able to interact with the program from
                    the command line.<br><br>

                <p>
                    For my senior capstone project I was apart of a team of 6 other software engineers that were tasked with researching
                    and developing a program that would utilize advanced linear algebra concepts such as the Fast Fourier Transform and
                    Irational Discrete Base Weighted Transform on Googles Cloud TPU technology in the hopes of speeding up the algorithm 
                    to find a Mersenne Prime faster than exsisting Mersenne search programs. More information can be found 
                    on the WIKI page in the repository linked below.<br><br>
